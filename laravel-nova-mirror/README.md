> **This repository is not a public mirror. It can sync Nova downloads using your personal credentials to a private repository of your choice.**

This application enables you to update a private mirror of Laravel Nova automatically. It downloads releases from the Nova site and updates a repository with the correct releases. 

The application assumes the user which runs it has git access to the repository. The best way to do this using an ssh key. You need to enter the username and password to your account on nova.laravel.org to get this to work.

This repository was created because Nova only supplies a download which you need to copy to your project. This feels way too old-school and makes updating a bit hard. Using this application you can include nova directly from the git repository which should make updating a lot easier.

Run this on a CI once a day, and you will have an up-to-date Nova available whenever you need it.   

Please note; the repository you mirror to must be private, as per license agreement with Nova. 

## Getting started

1. Start with installing the project with composer ```composer create-project swisnl/laravel-nova-mirror```
1. Setup the .env file (or environment) with the correct credentials. 
1. Make sure the remote repository exists.
1. Run `php artisan nova-mirror:update` to download and push the repository or run Dusk directly `php artisan dusk` to do the same.
1. Setup your Nova project to pull from your private repository.

```json
